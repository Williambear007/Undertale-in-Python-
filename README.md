# Undertale-in-Python!

WARNING: THIS IS IN EARLY ACCESS EXPECT BUGS AND HORRIBLE CODE!

Here is a somewhat origial undertale fan game. It is meant to be a mix of cult of the lamb, doki doki literature club, ultrakill and deltarune.


HOW TO INSTALL AND SET EVERYTHING UP
1. Install python from python.org
2. Go to CMD (if you are here you should know what that is by now) and run "pip install pygame"
3. This will install the module for all the graphics and stuff (yay).
4. Go into the folder and run "main.py"
5. As of 9/9/25, you don't have to do anything extra, but in the future I can promise that I'll fix the code and optimise it.
6. Do whatever you please with it. I don't need credit.
